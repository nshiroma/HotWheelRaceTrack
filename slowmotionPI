# For this to work you need to have MP4Box installed
# You can do this by using:
# sudo apt-get install gpac

# The recorded file is recorded with high fps speed. Now we need to change its properties
# so when playing it back it is played at a lower fps rate, so we get the slow motion effect.
# We will use tha MP4Box program to process our video
# The output will be at 15 fps for a more dramatic effect.
